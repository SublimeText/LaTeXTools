## Prereleases

LaTeXTools uses pre-releases to beta test new features and improve the stability of releases. If you also want to get the newest features and help us testing them. Just open *Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User* and insert at a reasonable (correct JSON syntax) position: 

``` js
    "install_prereleases": ["LaTeXTools"],
```

If you also use prereleases of other packages just add them comma separated into the list.


## Overview

This plugin provides several features that simplify working with LaTeX files:

* The ST build command takes care of compiling your LaTeX source to PDF using `texify` (Windows/MikTeX) or `latexmk` (OSX/MacTeX, Windows/TeXlive, Linux/TeXlive). Then, it parses the log file and lists errors and warning. Finally, it launches the PDF viewer and, on supported viewers ([Sumatra PDF](http://sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) on Windows, [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) on OSX, and [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince) on Linux by default) jumps to the current cursor position.
* Forward and inverse search with the named PDF previewers is fully supported
* Fill everything including references, citations, packages, graphics, figures, etc.
* Plugs into the "Goto anything" facility to make jumping to any section or label in your LaTeX file(s)
* Smart command completion for a variety of text and math commands
* Additional snippets and commands are also provided
* Fully customizable build command
* Fully customizable PDF viewers
* Full support for project files and multi-file documents
* Easily view package documentation
* Word counts

## Requirements and Setup

The easiest way to install LaTeXTools is via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). See [the Package Control installation instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) for details on how to set it up (it's very easy.) Once you have Package Control up and running, invoke it (via the **Command Palette** from the Tools menu, or from Preferences), select the **Install Package** command, and find **LaTeXTools**.

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, you can always clone the git repository, or else just grab this plugin's .zip file from GitHub and extract it to your Packages directory (you can open it easily from ST, by clicking on **Preferences > Browse Packages**). Then, (re)launch ST. Please note that if you do a manual installation, the Package **must** be named **LaTeXTools**.

Finally, you'll need to have a working TeX installation and a PDF viewer. LaTeXTools supports [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), [MiKTeX](http://www.miktex.org/) and [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) as TeX systems and [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/), [Sumatra PDF](http://sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html), [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince), [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/), and [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) as PDF viewers. For detailed instructions on how to set these up, please see [our online documentation](http://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/)!
