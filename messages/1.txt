LaTeXTools Plugin version 2012-09-17 17:22:00 changelog:

THE KEYBINDINGS (a.k.a. keyboard shortcuts) HAVE CHANGED!!!

I have not used a changelog before, but this change is important enough! There are several other changes if you haven't looked at the plugin for a while. 

To learn about the new keybindings and features, go to the Github page:

https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools

and scroll down to the README file. Actually, the Markdown source of that file is in the plugin directory, which you can open using "Browse Packages..." in Sublime Text 2.
