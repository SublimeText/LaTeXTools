LaTeXTools Plugin version 2013-06-18 changelog:

I'm back! Finally, I anticipate having some spare time to work on LaTeXTools! This will be
the first of hopefully many updates! Thank you for your continued support and PATIENCE :)

New features:

- Basic support for biblatex bibliographies (contributed by Jeremy Jay)

Bugs fixed:

- When jumping to PDF using the keybinding (C-l,j), honor the
  "keep_focus" setting and the focus toggle.

- Added "/opt/local/bin" path on OSX. Note: this is a temporary fix; I
  am planning a slight refactoring of build configuration that will
  hopefully give greater flexibility.
