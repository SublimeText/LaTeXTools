LaTeXTools Plugin version 4.0.0
-------------------------------

This is a major update targetting ST 3143+ and ST 4107+.

ST2 support is completely removed and support for ST 4107+ and python 3.8 is added.

All commnands have been renamed to follow a common naming schema.
Therefore customized key bindings need to be updated.

To easily find them, run `LaTeXTools: Find deprecated commands` from Command Palette,
if a key bindings file is opened. Note: It requires PackageDev to be installed.
