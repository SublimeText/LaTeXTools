LaTeXTools 4.4.0
----------------

  LaTeXTools is now installed as normal sublime-package file.

  Sublime Text needs to be restarted for the plugin to function again.

  File based LaTeXTools specific plugin ecosystem has been replaced
  to maintain compatibility with future versions of python and Sublime Text.

  Plugins are therefore no longer searched and loaded by file name.
  Instead all sub-classes of `LaTeXToolsPlugin` class are automatically
  registered if their owning python module is loaded.

  This should also resolve an issue, which caused builder or viewer plugins
  to no longer work after upgrades, until ST is restarted.

  If you encounter any issues, please open an issue at:
