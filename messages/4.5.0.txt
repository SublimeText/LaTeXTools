LaTeXTools 4.5.0
----------------

  The major changes of this release are:

    1. rewritten dbus based viewer plugin for Evince and XReader on Linux.

    2. overhauled PDF builder infrastructure and default builders.

    It should not affect normal usage of default functionality in obvious ways,
    except build menu now displaying "Compile to PDF" instad of "LaTeX".

    Existing custom builder plugins may however need some adoption, even though
    primary API changes target improved consistency and extended functionality, only.

    Expected changes are primarily related with printing command results
    or creation of custom `Popen` commands, which a dedicated method was added for.

    Please refer to https://sublimetext.github.io/LaTeXTools/buildsystem/ to get some
    information about current API. A dedicated migration guide does not exist, but
    a look at default builders' code may give some hints about required adaptions.

  Fixes:

    - fix skim script path argument (#1639)
    - fix aux- and output-directory usage with latexmk (#1640)
    - fix SumatraPDF not reloading re-build PDFs (#1642)
    - fix build cancellation support

  Enhancements:

    - support Xreader, refresh support for Evince (#1557)
    - improve translation of special char in auto label (#1637)
    - replace `copy_output_on_build` functionality by
      proper output-directory support in all default builders.
    - overhaul builder infrastructure and default builder plugins
    - publish updated documentation at https://sublimetext.github.io/LaTeXTools/ (fixes #1643)
