LaTeXTools Plugin version 2012-10-14 changelog:

New features:

- 


Bugs fixed:

- Robustified command and environment completion (C-l,c and C-l,e) so starred versions 
  of commands/environments are OK

- Robustified makePDF.py; now it should always fail gracefully when it cannot parse tex file names,
  and kindly ask the user to report the bug on GitHub :-) Note TODO: better filename regexp!

- Ignore non-ascii chars in output of "ps xw" when checking if evince is running (avoids crashes)
