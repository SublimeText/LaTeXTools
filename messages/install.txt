Thank you for installing the LaTeXTools plugin!

To learn about the features of this plugin, go to the Github page:

https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools

and scroll down to the README file. Actually, the Markdown source of that file is in the plugin directory, which you can open using "Browse Packages..." in Sublime Text.
