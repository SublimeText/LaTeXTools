LaTeXTools Plugin version 2015-11-22

Thank you for installing the LaTeXTools plugin!

To learn about the features of this plugin, go to the Github page:

https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools

and scroll down to the README file. Actually, the Markdown source of that file is in the plugin directory, which you can open using "Browse Packages..." in Sublime Text.

You can also check out my blog at

Happy TeXing!
