LaTeXTools Plugin version 4.0.0-alpha.0 (2017-06-05) changelog:

Features:
- Improved support for the subfiles package. Now the preamble of the root file will be taken into account in the document analysis (and hence in fill-all helper/cwl completions/...).
- Added support for the \graphicspath{...} command.
- Improved toggle settings command (C-l, t, ?). This will called if you use an unknown toggle and can be edited via the settings.
- Improve fill-all helper support for glossary completions to show more information in the overlay.
