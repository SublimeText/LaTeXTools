LaTeXTools Plugin version 3.15.0 (2018-04-21) changelog:

Features:

- Cache uses constant for _invalid_object. This should fix many issues the cache sometimes causes, but requires cache to be cleared by running the **LaTeXTools: Clear cache** command.

- Better support for non-Latin-1 codepages on Windows.

- Added a link to open the full log file to the builder output.

N.B. Future development that supports ST2 or ST3 prior to the introduction of phantoms will stop after this (minor) release.
