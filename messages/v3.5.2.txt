LaTeXTools Plugin version 3.5.2 (2015-12-07) changelog:

Please welcome Ian Bacher (ig0774) who will help maintain and improve
LaTeXTools! Ian has already contributed lots of cool code to the project,
both fixing bugs and extending features. I am excited to see the LaTeXTools
team grow from 1 to 2 :-)

New feature:

- Switched to a tags-based release system. There should be no user-visible change,
  except that Package Control will report version numbers such as "v3.5.2"
- Added support for changing the environment (R. Stein)
- Automatic citation from a one-item bibliography
- Added error handling in case no log file is produced
- View package documentation

Bugfixes:

- Various README fixes
- Autocomplete bugs
- Log parsing fixes (duplicate identifiers)
