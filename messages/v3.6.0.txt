LaTeXTools Plugin version 3.6.0 (2015-12-12) changelog:

This is a pretty significant release, so we are going to bump up the "minor"
version number. Most of the work is due to Ian Bacher and Richard Stein.


New features:

- Project-overridable settings! This allows you to specify, for instance, a different
  tex engine or different tex options for a specific project, without changing your 
  general user settings.
- Configurable tex extensions! This is a long-requested feature. We introduce a new
  option that allows you to specify which file extensions will be treated as "tex" in
  LaTeXTools. This is useful, for instance, if you use Sweave/knitr, or if you edit 
  .dtx files
- Jump to included images (graphics files)

Bugfixes:

- Workaround to ensure keep_focus works on Windows
- Fix kpsewhich on OS X
- Fix Beamer angle brackets snippet
