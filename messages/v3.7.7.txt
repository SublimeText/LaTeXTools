LaTeXTools Plugin version 3.7.7 (2016-04-21) changelog:

**Note**: If you've been following along with the v3.7.x release, v3.7.7 is a major change. I've restored the previous bibliography parsing from v3.6 and earlier as default. If you want to use the new parsing, you need to change the `bibliography` setting to `"new_bibliography"`.

Features:

- Re-added previous bibliography behaviour as default. New bibliography behaviour can be obtained by changing the `bibliography` setting to `"new_bibliography"`.

Bugfixes:

- Properly support "value and and value" (interpretted the same as "value and value")
- KEY now cannot have an equals sign, which solves an issue related to URLs in the bibliography
